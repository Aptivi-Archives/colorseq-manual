# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Welcome to ColorSeq! It's a library that manages the VT color sequences and gets information about them. It's used to print the VT sequences to change the color, check whether the color is bright or dark, get RGB values from 255 colors, and much more.

To use this library, go to any page in the left side of the screen.

## Installation

This library is very easy to install. It's available at [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ColorSeq/). Just follow these steps:

1. Open your project file (`.csproj` or `.fsproj`)
2. Place the `PackageReference` line on a property group like so:
   * `<PackageReference Include="ColorSeq" Version="x.x.x" />`
   * ...where `Version` is the current version of the library
3. Run a package restore using `dotnet restore`

If you follow these steps correctly, you should be able to use the ColorSeq functions.
